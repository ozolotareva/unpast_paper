# Paper Figure Generation Requirements
# =====================================
# This file lists all dependencies needed to run the refactored paper figure generation code.
# Tested with Python 3.9+ and the conda environment at /Users/michi/opt/anaconda3/envs/test

# Core data manipulation
# ----------------------
pandas==1.4.2                  # DataFrame operations, data loading and processing
numpy==1.22.3                  # Numerical operations, array handling

# Plotting and visualization
# ---------------------------
matplotlib==3.7.1              # Core plotting library, figure creation
seaborn==0.12.0                # Statistical data visualization built on matplotlib

# Scientific computing
# ---------------------
scipy==1.7.1                   # Scientific functions (may be used by statsmodels or seaborn)

# Optional but recommended
# ------------------------
Pillow>=9.3.0                  # Image processing (for figure validation with validate_figures.py --pixel-check)

# Notes:
# ------
# 1. The version constraints are based on the reference environment that was used
#    to develop and test the original Jupyter notebook.
#
# 2. matplotlib 3.7.1 is specified to match the reference environment. Earlier
#    versions may have different APIs that could cause issues.
#
# 3. seaborn 0.12.0 introduced some API changes. Using 0.12.x ensures compatibility
#    with the barplot and violinplot functions used in the code.
#
# 4. pandas 1.4.2 is recommended. Pandas 2.0+ introduced breaking changes that may
#    require code modifications.
#
# 5. The 'settings' module is a custom module located in the parent directory
#    (scratch/settings.py) and is not included in this requirements file.
#
# 6. Data files must be present in:
#    - scratch/data/simulated_data/  (for simulated figures)
#    - scratch/data/real_data/       (for BRCA figures)
#
# Installation:
# -------------
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or with conda:
# conda install --file requirements.txt
#
# Tested Environment:
# -------------------
# - Python 3.9
# - macOS (Darwin 25.0.0)
# - Conda environment: /Users/michi/opt/anaconda3/envs/test
